* ------------------------ TODO list ----------------------------
* Work on CGR code
** TODO Fix gain setting
   - I really dont' think my tiny mp3 player is putting out 10V
** DONE Get the control register setting into the library
** DONE Get the hardware gain setting into the library
** DONE Get the trigger level setting into the library
** DONE Use cgr_cal to determine what offsets should be
   - Run through a calibration sequence for each gain stage
** DONE In cgrcal, get_offsets should set values in the dictionary
** DONE Change name of make_cal_data to get_cal_data
** DONE Move get_cal_data into the library
** TODO Fix trigger function to use the caldict calibration
   - The set_trig_level function is just calibration in reverse.  Need
     to use the calibration coefficients to arrive at a number in
     counts from a floating-point voltage.  Also, make set_trig_level
     use gainlist instead of independent gains.
