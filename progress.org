* protoscript progress
* ----------------------- Dated notes ---------------------------
** <2013-09-01 Sun> Created this project
* ------------------------ TODO list ----------------------------
* Work on CGR code
** TODO Move all settings to configuration file
** TODO Make option to force trigger while waiting for trigger
   - This will require the curses module.  That will require some learning.
** DONE Pull out old testlib messages
   - These should be handled by the logger
** DONE Add list of serial ports not detected by comports
   - This will help with the cygwin situation
** TODO Create dummy connection
** DONE Get the control register setting into the library
** DONE Get the hardware gain setting into the library
** DONE Get the trigger level setting into the library
** DONE Use cgr_cal to determine what offsets should be
   - Run through a calibration sequence for each gain stage
** DONE In cgrcal, get_offsets should set values in the dictionary
** DONE Change name of make_cal_data to get_cal_data
** DONE Move get_cal_data into the library
** DONE Fix trigger function to use the caldict calibration
   - The set_trig_level function is just calibration in reverse.  Need
     to use the calibration coefficients to arrive at a number in
     counts from a floating-point voltage.  Also, make set_trig_level
     use gainlist instead of independent gains.
** DONE Modify cgr_capture to use the new library functions
** DONE Combine trigger settings into a dictionary
   - Trigger source, trigger samples, trigger level
   - This dictionary should get passed to the function that gets
     triggered data, so it can say something like: waiting for a 1V trigger on channel A.
** DONE Warn on actual sample frequency when different than requested
** DONE Make info message for what unit reports as end of capture location
** DONE Draw crosshairs at the trigger point
** DONE Get milliseconds out of logger time string
** DONE Move trigger level x3into a separate config file
** TODO Make a function that loads a configuration file
   - Or makes a new one if one is not found.
** TODO Calibration coefficients should go in the configuration file
** TODO Make function to fill trigger dictionary
   - The configuration file is read using the libary function, and the
     configuration file object is returned to the application code.
     So this object can be passed to a library function again, and the
     library function can return a populated trigger dictionary.
** TODO Switch configuration handling to configobj
   - http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/configobj.html
